Need to make Frame class that is created when "add frame" button is clicked

Frame class contains:
    - aspect ratio
    - size (base on aspect ratio)
    - path to picture (chosen by user, need to find library that accomplishes this)
    - border thickness and color  (chosen by user, find a color wheel library)
    - At first just do one photo, then can move onto shuffling through photos
        - shuffle logic
            - only display files that are photos, if not a photo then skip
            - no repeats until all photos have been displayed
            - interval
    - delete frame function





Eventual Ideas:
- when program launched, goes back to state it was in before it was closed last
- connect to google photos
- suffle a folder of photos 
 - add transisiton effects
- use new UI tool/library to make look better


Bugs to fix:
- when switching frame size it will also switch back to default aspect ratio (3:2)

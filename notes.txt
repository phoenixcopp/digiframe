To set up Google Picker API in a Java Swing project like yours, you need to understand that the Picker API is a JavaScript API intended for web applications.
However, you can still use it in a desktop Java app by embedding a browser component (like JavaFX WebView or JxBrowser) and handling OAuth2 authentication.

General Steps:
1. Create a Google Cloud Project and Enable Picker API
Go to Google Cloud Console.
Create a project.
Enable the Google Picker API and Google Drive API.
Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Client ID for Desktop or Web application).
2. Set Up OAuth2 Authentication in Java
Use a library like Google OAuth Client Library for Java or Google Drive API Java Quickstart for authentication.
Obtain an access token.
3. Embed a Browser in Your Java App
Use JavaFX WebView (built-in with JavaFX) or a third-party browser like JxBrowser or Java Chromium Embedded Framework (JCEF).
Display a minimal HTML page that loads the Picker API.
4. Pass OAuth Token to Picker API in the Embedded Browser
Inject the OAuth token into the HTML/JavaScript context.
Use JavaScript to launch the Picker and handle file selection.
5. Communicate Selection Back to Java
Use the browserâ€™s Java-JavaScript bridge to send the selected file(s) back to your Java code.
